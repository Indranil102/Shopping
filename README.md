## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local development environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Indranil102/shopper-ecommerce.git
   cd shopper-ecommerce
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. The page will reload if you make edits. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

This is a one-way operation that gives you full control over the build configuration. Use with caution.
